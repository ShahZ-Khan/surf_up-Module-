PURPOSE
The purpose of the analysis is to determine the temperature trends in Oahu, Hawaii. Mainly to determine if opening a Surf and Shake shop serving surfboards and ice cream can be profitable. Statistics of temperature were requested for the months of June and December to understand the climate and make a informed decision.

The average recorded temperature in June is about 77 degrees F, 4 degrees higher than the average temp in December.
This shows a change in average temperature from June to December. Understanding that the tempertures are differnt in these months. 
The frequency of temperatures recorded in June tends is much normal compared to the offset temperatures in December.
The December temperatures seem to be more stable than those in June.

SUMMARY

I would summize that even though temperatures recorded in December seem to vary more than those of June, December would still provide appropriate weather conditions for both surfing and demand in ice cream. The average temperatures in June and December are not differnt to change the outcome of sales and profits. I feel more confident in pursuing with the plan because the average temperture is similar in these months. Starting a pilot plan to better understand the outcome can provide a better result.
